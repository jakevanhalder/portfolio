                        <p>Nov 2023 - Feb 2024</p>
                        <p>
                            The reason why I decided to build a personal portfolio website is because I wanted a space for people to get to know me, and interact with the things that I am passionate about.
                            This page is just to relay the process I went through while building this project.
                            If you want to see the source code for this project, you can find it at this link <a href="https://github.com/jakevanhalder/portfolio">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <div class="even-columns">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    I always start with a plan and a design for what I want to build. 
                                    For this project I wanted to be able to share who I am, and display some of the things that I am passionate about. 
                                    As you may have noticed by the top navigation, I planned to convey this through four main categories, which are my landing or home page, about me, personal coding projects, and photography. 
                                    Once I had these categories, I had to build a wire-frame to really see what I would be working with. 
                                    A tool I love to use to make wire-frames is a web application called Figma. 
                                    As you can see in the picture to the right, I try to plan out everything I build before I get to coding it.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <img src="../pictures/personal-portfolio-plan.png" alt="A prototype design of the personal portfolio website">
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="even-columns">
                            <div>
                               <img src="../pictures/personal-portfolio-vscode.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    After I have a basic overview of my project, I start to think of the tools I would need to build it out. 
                                    Since I'm building out a website, I decided to go with what I knew best, which would be the traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript approach. 
                                    To keep track of the changes I made to my code I used GitHub, and finally, to bring these tools all together, I used Microsoft's source-code editor, VS Code. 
                                    With these tools and the wire-frame, all that was left was to simply code out the plan I had already set out.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            A big problem that I ran into with this project was tackling the different display resolutions that this portfolio website could be viewed at. 
                            This took a lot of time to overcome, and after a lot of research, I was able to design something that properly conveyed what I wanted, in the way I wanted. 
                            Another key area that I sought to tackle came from researching different ways to make this website more accessible. 
                            I really wanted people of all backgrounds to have the opportunity to navigate through this website, and I put in a lot of effort to try and realize this. 
                            If at any point in this website you find that there is an area that could be improved that would make it easier for you to navigate, please send me an email at jakevhbusiness@gmail.com I would love to hear any recommendations that you may have!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For now, this is how my website stands and I wont be changing any of its designs/components for a while. 
                            However, when I do decide to revisit updating this project, some things I would love improve would be to implement a more colorful design, and some cool animations when interacting with the various content/navigation that's scattered across this project. 
                            If you've reached this sentence, thank you for showing interest in something I've made. 
                            Have a great rest of your day, and I hope to see you again!
