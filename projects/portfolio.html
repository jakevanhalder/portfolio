                        <p>
                            I decided to build a personal portfolio website because I wanted a space for people to get to know me and interact with the things that I am passionate about.
                            If you want to see the source code for this project, you can find it at this link <a href="https://github.com/jakevanhalder/portfolio">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <div class="even-columns">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    As with all projects, I always start with a plan and a design for what I want to build. 
                                    Since my goal was to share who I am as well as some of the things that I am passionate about, I had to make sure everything on this website reflected that goal. 
                                    As you may have noticed by the top navigation, I planned to convey this through four main categories, which are my landing or home page, about me, personal coding projects, and my favorite hobby, photography. 
                                    Once I had these categories, I built a wireframe to plan out how the content would be structured on each individual web page as well as how the user would interact with it. 
                                    A tool I love to use to make wireframes is a web application called Figma, which helps produce these designs efficiently.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <img src="../pictures/personal-portfolio-plan.png" alt="A prototype design of the personal portfolio website">
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="even-columns">
                            <div>
                               <img src="../pictures/personal-portfolio-vscode.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    After I have a basic overview of my project, I start to think about the tools I need to build it out. 
                                    Since I'm building out a website, I decided to go with what I knew best, which would be the traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript approach. 
                                    To keep track of the changes I made to my code, I used GitHub, and finally, to bring these tools together, I used Microsoft's source-code editor, VS Code. 
                                    Since I already planned everything out beforehand, all I had to do was simply code out the plan I had already set out.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            A big problem that I ran into with this project was tackling the different display resolutions that this portfolio website could be viewed at. 
                            This took a lot of time to overcome, and after a lot of research, I was able to design something that properly conveyed what I wanted in the way I wanted at different display resolutions. 
                            Another key area that I sought to tackle was ensuring that my website was accessible and inclusive. 
                            I didn't want someone to struggle while navigating throughout my website, especially when I could do something about it, as there are more than enough resources online to realize this. 
                            I really wanted people of all backgrounds to have the opportunity to navigate throughout this website, and I will always try to ensure this. 
                            If you find that there is an area that could be improved that would make it easier for you to navigate this website, please contact me personally at <a aria-label="E-mail" href="mailto:jakevhbusiness@gmail.com">jakevhbusiness@gmail.com</a>. 
                            I would love to hear and implement any recommendations that you may have!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For now, this is how my website stands and I wont be changing any of its designs/components for a while. 
                            However, when I do decide to revisit updating this project, some things I would love to improve would be to implement a more colorful design, and some cool animations when interacting with the various content/navigation that's scattered across this project. 
                            If you've reached this sentence, thank you for showing interest in something I've made. 
                            Have a great rest of your day, and I hope to see you again!
