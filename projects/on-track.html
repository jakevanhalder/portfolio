                            On Track is a command-line program that aims to help the user with their day-to-day life by taking away the mental stress of daily menial tasks. 
                            This program aims to accomplish this goal through three distinct categories, which are home, planning, and expenses. 
                            If you want to see the source code for this project, you can find it at this link <a href="https://github.com/jakevanhalder/On-Track">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <div class="even-columns">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Since On Track is a command-line program, I didn't have to worry about making the application's design look pretty. 
                                    However, I still did plan out the program by briefly sketching out the features that I wanted to implement into it. 
                                    Once I had a brief overview of the various components that would be implemented in the application, I started to flesh out their purpose even further to make sure that nothing was redundant.

                                    I decided to code this project in C++ as I currently don't have any projects that showcase this language, and I thought it would be a fun language to use for building On Track. 
                                    I then decided to use Github as my version-control software and Microsoft's source-code editor, VS Code. 
                                    I also decided to use CMake, which is an open-source, platform-independent build system, so that anyone, regardless of their platform, could use this software.
